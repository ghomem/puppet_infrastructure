Hashman - Puppet hash manager

Requirements:

apt-get install python-flask python-cracklib python-setproctitle

Customization:
Default logo and favicon are installed at httpserver/static/img/. If they are overwritten by the sysadmin Puppet let's go of them.

Plugins are in the template directory.

Hashman accepts plugins of the following types:

* type 1 - standalone plugin which receives no CLI arguments (ex: local puppet run)
* type 2 - plugin that receives only an informative message as a CLI argument (ex: local git backup)
* type 3 - plugin that receives user information and an informative message via CLI (ex: IPBrick users sync)

These plugins reside at plugins/{1,2,3} respectively.
